## Installation

```git clone https://github.com/Shaners/C.git```

## Usage

A resource with examples of how to accomplish certain things in this programming language.

1. Compile the .c file you are interested in
2. Execute, providing arguments as needed
3. Review code in .c file

###hello.c
Run ```./hello```

Sanity check, for beginners, or people returning to C after being away for awhile.

###friendly.c
You must install the CS50 library for this to work. See the [CS50 Library Installation instructions](https://manual.cs50.net/library/#installation). We do this because gets() is dangerous and the heavy lifting is already done with CS50 GetString() function.

Run ```./friendly```

Take some input in a prompt and safely return it back to the user.
